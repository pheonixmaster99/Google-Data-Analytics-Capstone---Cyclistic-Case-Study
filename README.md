# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone---Cyclistic-Case-Study
## Introduction
  In this case study, I will perform the real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company - Cyclistic. The answer of key business questions, will be done through the data analyst process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Act, and Share. 

## Cyclistic
  Cyclistic has had a successful bike-share program, since its launch in 2016. As of now, the program has grown into a fleet of 5824 bicycles which are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Thus far, Cyclistic's strategy has been on buiding general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The approach that helped make the company possible was the flexibility of the company's pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passess, and annual memberships. Anyone who purchases single-day or full-day passes are known as 'casual' riders, while anyone who purchases annual membership as known as 'members'.

  Cyclistic has determined the annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Though  flexibie pricing helps Cyclistic attract customers, the management believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to attracting growth. As such, there has been an effort launched to convert more casual riders into members. To do this, Lily Moreno - Director of Marketing - at Cyclistic, has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

  In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
