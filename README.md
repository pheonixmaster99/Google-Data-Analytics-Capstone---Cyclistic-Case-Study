# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone---Cyclistic-Case-Study
# Introduction
  In this case study, I will perform the real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company - Cyclistic. The answer of key business questions, will be done through the data analyst process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Act, and Share. 

# Cyclistic
  Cyclistic has had a successful bike-share program, since its launch in 2016. As of now, the program has grown into a fleet of 5824 bicycles which are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Thus far, Cyclistic's strategy has been on buiding general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The approach that helped make the company possible was the flexibility of the company's pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passess, and annual memberships. Anyone who purchases single-day or full-day passes are known as 'casual' riders, while anyone who purchases annual membership as known as 'members'.

  Cyclistic has determined the annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Though  flexibie pricing helps Cyclistic attract customers, the management believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to attracting growth. As such, there has been an effort launched to convert more casual riders into members. To do this, Lily Moreno - Director of Marketing - at Cyclistic, has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

  In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# Ask
## Business Task
Devise marketing strategies necessary to convert casual riders into annual members.

Three questions guide the future of the marketing program:
  1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
  2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
  3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Lily Moreno - a key stakeholder - has assigned us the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Stakeholders
The key stakeholders in this are Lily Moreno - Director of Marketing, and the Cyclistic executive team, who will ultimately be responsible for approving the marketing deal. 

# Prepare
## Data Source
I will use Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends from Jan 2023 to May 2023. The data can be downloaded from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), with the data itself being made avaialble by Motivate International Inc. under his [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Data Organization
In the end, 4 files were downloaded for Cyclistic usage from January through May 2023. The files include information such as ride_id, bike_type,start time, end time, start station, end station, start location, end location, and membership type. 

# Process
The tools being used to analyze the data are Google Spreadsheet and then combined together using R as the overall worksheet had 1,065,942 data points. 

## Combining the Data
> Talk about using Google Spreadsheet to clear duplicates before combining the data as well. 
> Talk about using R to upload the packages
## Data Exploration
> Talk about any observations made by you with regards to the data
  >  The fact that thee are three unique types of bike
  >  The fact that membership type are two unique values: 'Member' and 'Casual'
  > Talk about any null values (leave it for Data cleaning section as well)

## Data Cleaning
> Talk about any data that you removed such as empty rows, duplicate rows, and rows hours for riding were not less than or equivalet to zero.
